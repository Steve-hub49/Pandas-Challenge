This is my repository link for HW4 pandas-challenge material.

The Jupyter Notebook was developed to address the task of analyzing data for the Heroes of Pymoli fantasy game.

My three observable trends based on Heroes of Pymoli data:
1. Of the 576 players, the overwhelming majority are male (84%). The balance of players are spread between female (14%)
and other / non-disclosed individuals (2%). While I would have guessed a preponderance of male players, I did not expect
the distribution to be so skewed. From the standpoint of planning for future business, it would be interesting to study
trend shifts across the male / female/ other groups over the past decade.
2. The 20-24 year old player group represents a critical target market for the House of Pymoli management team. Not only do they
account for the largest age demographic, this group also leads in overall purchases as well as total purchase value. A
relative cash cow, this group must be defended as strategies for future growth are developed.
3. While the average purchase price among those spending money on optional items is relatively even across gender groups,
it is noteworthy that the smallest gender group (other / non-disclosed) spends the most on average for optional items
($3.35 versus $3.02 for males and $3.20 for females). Based on the results of necessary research, it may make sense to
consider increasing marketing and product development spend on this group.

Please know my final version of code is located in the [HeroesOfPymoli](https://github.com/Steve-hub49/pandas-challenge/tree/master/HeroesOfPymoli) folder and is called HW4_heroesofpymoli.ipynb.
